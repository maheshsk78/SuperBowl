# SuperBowl - DataCamp Project
## Mahesh Kumar's tribute to Michael Lewis 

#### A big fan of the movie moneyball, I decided to pursue maths, stats and programming. 
#### I came across this project on DataCamp where the objective was trying to predict who will win the next SuperBowl - (Behavioral Statistics)
#### Based on stats, and the data provided, this was my attempt at trying to replicate my learnings outside the field of academia
